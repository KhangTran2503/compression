# The design and implementation data compression algorithms

## Decription

In this project, we will implement some data compression algorithms using Python, includes:
> - [Run Length Coding algorithm (for text)](Run_Length_Encoding.ipynb)
>
> - [LZW algorithm (for text)](LZW_Coding.ipynb)
> 
> - [Shannon-Fano algorithm (for text)](Shannon_Fano_Coding.ipynb)
>
> - [Arithmetic algorithm (for text)](Arithmetic_Coding.ipynb)
>
> - [K-Mean compression algorithm (for image)](Image_Compression_using_K_means.ipynb)
